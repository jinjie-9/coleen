                    <p style="margin-top: 500px;">Time flies, it only seem like yesterday that we have just graduated from secondary school. Really grateful for having you as my friend, my English guidance, a team leader that I always look up to. It will not be the same without you throughout my secondary life. All the memories with you in the class will be remembered. Congratulations on starting this exciting new chapter in your life in Australia! I wish you all the best and see you again…

                    <p style="margin-top: -100px;">Hi Coleen, 

                        It’s been a great 4-5 years knowing you and being classmates with you. You have always been the one whom i am looking up to as you are always putting in a lot of efforts in the things you are pursuing and having a clear goal in mind to work towards with. Although after secondary school we never meet as often, i am sure those memories that we have with each other will always remain in our heart. I mean it’s a bit sad knowing that you are moving overseas and probably we will never see each other again soon but please if you happen to come back to Singapore do come and find us. Of course, my bad for not being able to hang out with you guys this few years due to my academic schedule. But i will make sure once my A levels is over i will definitely catch up with y’all and pls do come back and find us. lastly, just hope for the best for you in doing everything and wish you all the best for your future endeavours. Safe Flight and see u soon…
